                  Halifax is a minster and market town in the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, England. It is the commercial, cultural 
                  and administrative centre of the borough, and the headquarters of Calderdale Council. In the 15th century, the town became an economic hub 
                  of the old West Riding of Yorkshire, primarily in woollen manufacture. Halifax is the largest town in the wider Calderdale borough. Halifax 
                  was a thriving mill town during the industrial revolution.
