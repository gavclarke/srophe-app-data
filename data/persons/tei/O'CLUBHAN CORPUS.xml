                     <p>Errors corrected by the author have been marked using the elements 'del' and 'add' with the addition of 'hand' to show where these deletions and additions are holograph
                         where 'hand' is not included the corrections were made by typewriter. No attempt at normalisation has been made. The primary unit for editorial intervention is the individual character speech as the editor discerns this as the basic unit of revision for the author and unit of comprehension for the reader. The inclusion of facsimile pages for reader reference and further technical aspects of the TEI mark-up process encourage this approach: multiple deletions by the author cross line breaks and thus breach TEI hierarchies, while there are open-tag solutions for marking up such continuing deletions while retaining line-breaks the resulting density of mark-up increases the likelihood of mistakes, confused mark-up and mitigates against future editorial revision as deletions are increasingly nested and editorial notes scattered across large complicated TEI structures. Excepting some special cases, editorial notes are given following the speech unit.</p>

           suggested rather than actual.  At any one time the audience can see both spaces.
           Sound FX suggest a busy street beyond the house and neighbours, there's a bit
           of D.I.Y. going on somewhere - the yuppies nextdoor?- mixed with the noises of 
           birds. <stage type= "direction"><name ref="#DermotFG">Dermot</name> is sitting on the step by the back door in the sunshine, he's

           him waiting for something.  He makes a few bird noises and picks up a pair of 
           binoclaurs and peers through them.  Nature does not respond.  He spots a cat
           and chucks something at it.</stage></p></set></front>

                   Perhaps the correction is made to avoid confusion with <name ref="#DermotFG">Dermot</name>'s friend and fellow prostitute 'Mark' as mentioned in Act1 Scene 1. As the 
                   variation of names does not seem to strongly signify any class or regional difference the corrected version (i.e. 'Adrian') is to be retained in the edition

               <note>The sum of money offered for the service above is first (1) typed then (2) overwritten by hand then further cancelled by hand;  (3)£1.00 
                  is written above the line in the author's hand. In it's overwritten state it includes the decimal pence symbol and seems to read '50p'. 
                  Some lines below this the price is first typed as a 'half crown' which is then cancelled out by the author and again £1.00 is written above the line.
                  The shift between decimal and pre-decimal is perhaps indicative of the author's drawing on biographical experiences in dramatising this 
                  encounter. Frank's ingenu status is underlined in the production flyer and only his age (19) and Pete's age at time of death (32) are established in the text 
                  but given the lack of reference to any significant disparity of ages between the characters and their depicted ease in each other's company my 
                  assumption is that Brian and Dermot are a few years older (perhaps 21-23) than Frank. Felix is perhaps a few years older again given the status of 
                  his city job. Based on political and cultural references throughout ('Neil Kinnock',...) an assumption of a time-setting contemporary to the production (1987) is made 
                  of the play. The tone of Dermot's recollection and the segue within a few lines to the account of his moving to London suggests the encouter is to 
                  be understood as happening in the character's early or middle teenage. It may be that the author was drawing on biographical experience in dramatising 
                  this encounter and in writing the pre-decimal versions of the sums was recalling the monetary system that would have obtained in his teenage years -
                  O'Clubhan (b. 1954) was 33 at the time of the production in 1987, decimal day in the UK and Ireland fell on 15 February 1971. Therefore the pre-decimal 
                  reference would work biographically up to the age of 17 for the author but would be far to early for actors/characters in their early 20s without signifying
                  abuse. The model for Pete may be O'Clubhan's older lover Gary who owned a house in Brixton, bequeathed on his death to O'Clubhan. This assumption 
               would further strengthen the argument above for ages in the play.</note>
